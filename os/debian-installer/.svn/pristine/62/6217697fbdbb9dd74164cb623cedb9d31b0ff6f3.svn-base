This document briefly describes how to make a installation-guide release.

- First make sure to be up to date

    svn up

- Set the release date

    dch -r

    and set the package version to the date.

- Commit that

    svn commit

    and remember the commit number (say, 12345)

- Prepare a bare tree

    svn export $PWD /tmp/manual-build

- Build from it (use a machine with a lot of cores to make this fast)

    cd /tmp/manual-build
    pdebuild

- Compare against a previous version to make sure we didn't mess it up
  completely

    debdiff installation-guide_2017WWWW_amd64.changes installation-guide_2017XXXX_amd64.changes

- Upload the result

- When ACCEPTed, Tag the commit:

    svn cp svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk/manual@12345 svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/tags/manual/2017XXXX
